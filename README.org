This branch ~executable-jar-maven-libs-outside~ stores a simplest demo for creating an executable jar using Maven that includes a main class as its entry point and third-party libs in a separate directory. Do not delete this branch or it may be hard to return here!

To build the executable jar, run ~mvn package~ under project root. A jar named =java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar= should be produced in the =target/package= folder, alongside a =libs= folder containing the dependencies.

Then you can run it with:

: cd target/package
: java -jar java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
