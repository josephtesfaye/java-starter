This branch ~executable-jar-maven-default~ stores a simplest demo for creating an executable jar using Maven. Do not delete this branch or it may be hard to return here!

To build the executable jar, run ~mvn package~ under project root. A jar named =java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar= should be produced in the =target= folder. It doesn't include a main class in its manifest. You can run it with:

: java -cp target/java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.josephtesfaye.javastarter.Main
