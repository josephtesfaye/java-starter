This branch ~executable-jar-maven-entrypoint~ stores a simplest demo for creating an executable jar using Maven that includes a main class as its entry point. Do not delete this branch or it may be hard to return here!

To build the executable jar, run ~mvn package~ under project root. A jar named =java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar= should be produced in the =target= folder. Then run it with ~java -jar target/java-starter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar~.
